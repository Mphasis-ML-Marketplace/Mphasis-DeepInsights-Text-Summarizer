    "\n",
    "DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Text Summarization is an optimal way to tackle the problem of information overload by reducing the size of long document into a few sentences or paragraphs.The recent advance in neural network architecture and training algorithms has shown the effectiveness of representation learning. The neural-network-based models generate better representation than the traditional ones. They have the ability to automatically learn the distributed representation for sentences and documents. This summarizer is built using Transfer Learning, Transformer based models which use self attention.\n",

      "Main article: History of self-driving cars\r\n",
      "Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[7] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[8][9]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab[10] and ALV[11][12] projects funded by DARPA starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project[13] in 1987. By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with obstacle avoidance added in 1986 and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.[14] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU's NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849 miles between Pittsburgh, PA and San Diego, CA, 2,797 miles were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8 miles per hour (102.3 km/h).[15][16][17][18] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the U.S. was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the U.S. Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[19] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[13][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The U.S. allocated $650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation, embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[28] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848 mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797 mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[29] Navlab's record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400 mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[30] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, D.C., allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[31]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In 2017, Audi stated that its latest A8 would be automated at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph) using its \"Audi AI\". The driver would not have to do safety checks such as frequently gripping the steering wheel. The Audi A8 was claimed to be the first production car to reach level 3 automated driving, and Audi would be the first manufacturer to use laser scanners in addition to cameras and ultrasonic sensors for their system.[32]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[33] however, there was still an employee in the car.[34] In October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[35] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the U.S.[36]\r\n",

      "Definitions\r\n",
      "There is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that \"Some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS at or above level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS).\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Words definition and safety considerations\r\n",
      "Modern vehicles provide partly automated features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls or emergency braking. Nonetheless, differences remain between a fully autonomous self-driving car on one hand and driver assistance technologies on the other hand. According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.[37]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think 'autonomous' and 'autopilot' means a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are self-driving, when they are only partly automated, drivers risk becoming excessively confident, leading to crashes, while fully self-driving cars are still a long way off in the UK.[38]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Autonomous vs. automated\r\n",
      "Autonomous means self-governing.[39] Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.[39]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity (for collision avoidance) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle's autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wood et al. (2012) wrote, \"This Article generally uses the term 'autonomous,' instead of the term 'automated.' \" The term \"autonomous\" was chosen \"because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. 'Automated' connotes control or operation by a machine, while 'autonomous' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver's seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term 'automated' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.\"[40] As of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. EuroNCAP defines autonomous in \"Autonomous Emergency Braking\" as: \"the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident.\" which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.[41]\r\n",

      "\u001b[35mExperiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[7] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[8][9]#015\u001b[0m\n",

By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with obstacle avoidance added in 1986 and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.[14] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU's NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849 miles between Pittsburgh, PA and San Diego, CA, 2,797 miles were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8 miles per hour (102.3 km/h).[15][16][17][18] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the U.S. was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the U.S. Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[19] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[13][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27]#015\u001b[0m\n",

The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[28] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848 mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797 mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[29] Navlab's record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400 mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[30] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, D.C., allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[31]#015\u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[34mWood et al. (2012) wrote, \"This Article generally uses the term 'autonomous,' instead of the term 'automated.' \" The term \"autonomous\" was chosen \"because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. 'Automated' connotes control or operation by a machine, while 'autonomous' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver's seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term 'automated' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.\"[40] As of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. EuroNCAP defines autonomous in \"Autonomous Emergency Braking\" as: \"the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident.\" which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.[41]#015\u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[35mWood et al. (2012) wrote, \"This Article generally uses the term 'autonomous,' instead of the term 'automated.' \" The term \"autonomous\" was chosen \"because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. 'Automated' connotes control or operation by a machine, while 'autonomous' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver's seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term 'automated' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.\"[40] As of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. EuroNCAP defines autonomous in \"Autonomous Emergency Braking\" as: \"the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident.\" which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.[41]#015\u001b[0m\n",
