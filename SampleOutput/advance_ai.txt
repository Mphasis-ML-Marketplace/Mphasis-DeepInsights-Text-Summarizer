The term and its various definitions the discipline was renamed in the late 19th century , primarily due to alfred marshall , from `` political economy '' to `` economics '' as a shorter term for `` economic science ''. Scottish philosopher adam smith ( 1776 ) defined what was then called political economy as `` an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations '' , in particular as : a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [ with the twofold objectives of providing ] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people. [ and ] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services. Alfred marshall provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook principles of economics ( 1890 ) that extends analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level : economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life.
