An autonomous car , also known as a robotic car , self-driving car , or driverless car ,   is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving with little or no human input. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths , as well as obstacles and relevant signage.
